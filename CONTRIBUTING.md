[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute.
Since this is a very fresh project now, contribution process flow is not
yet established.

You can send pull requests. If you don't know how to manipulate source files
but you want to contribute then you may create `New issue` on `Issues` as
stated on `README.md`.

For now, I would like to remind few highlights:

1. Contributors holds copyright on their parts. You, as a potential
contributor, don't transfer copyright ownership to me.
2. Contributors agree that their contributions are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0
as stated on `LICENSE.md`. You give permissions to other people to use your
contributions under the license.

If you like, you can also add your name to `docs/contributors.rst`.
