Welcome to notes on computer architecture! [#]_

You are on the home page of set of public notes. This is a collection of mostly
personal notes. Notes are (will be) mixture of:

* Lecture notes on courses offered in universities or other institutions.
* Processor history
* Paradigms like reconfigurable computing

but **NOT** about:

* Programming
* VHDL/Verilog
* Details of FPGA based designs

My main purpose is to collect my notes in one place. I prefer to share them
publicly because I believe that this will lead creation of more up-to-date
and more correct resource. Therefore, I would like to hear your feedback,
your comments and corrections. If you have anything to say, you can
:ref:`contact_page`.
Moreover, it would be great if you contribute by
creating new pages or fixing errors. Just check :ref:`contributing_page` page.

Lastly, I would like to kindly remind that all materials (including text) are
licensed and copyrighted. License is **CC-BY-SA-4.0** if otherwise stated.
You are free to share and adapt materials even for commercial purposes if you
follow license conditions. Just check :ref:`license_page`
and :ref:`copyright_page` page.
As stated in Section 5 of
CC-BY-SA-4.0 legal code, all materials (independent from chosen license)
are provided **AS-IS** and **NO
WARRANTY**. Check :ref:`disclaimer_page` page if you need.

I hope you enjoy.
