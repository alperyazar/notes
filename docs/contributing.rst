Contributing
============

**You can help to make this project better.**

Source code of the project is hosted on the following Github page.
|subs_src_page|

If you find a mistake, say something
about the project or content and don't want to bother with source code of the
pages then :ref:`contact_page`.

If you are comfortable with editing reStructuredText, compiling a Sphinx
project, git pull requests and Github that is great! Because it means that
you can edit source code of pages and send pull request to me. Just check
out |subs_src_page_contributing|.
